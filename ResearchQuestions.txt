How likely is it that an ex-mo will end up divorced?
	Maybe break up by demographics?
	Break up by whether spouse left as well
	
How far exmos land from church
	Current relationship
	
Create a profile and see how it works

Run correlation to see which variables I can collapse
	
Variables to use somehow 
	Convert vs. BIC vs. reactivated
	Calling - convert into linear scale
	
	
why left vs. what would make you come back / or some other measure of how likely to come back

How does why you left affect how likely you would be willing to come back?


In future interation of the survey, I need to add "District President" and simplify "secretary/clerk entry" to potential callings.
